# Two-Way Email Conversations for Contact Form

This document explains how to set up and use the two-way email conversation system that allows users to reply to support emails and have full conversations tracked in the admin panel.

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Two-way communication**: Users can reply to support emails
- **Conversation threading**: All emails are linked to the original contact submission
- **Real-time updates**: Incoming emails automatically appear in the admin panel
- **Full conversation history**: View complete email threads in the admin interface
- **Automatic tracking**: Conversation IDs embedded in all outgoing emails

## üîß **Setup Requirements**

### 1. **Resend Webhook Configuration**

You need to configure Resend to send webhooks for incoming emails:

1. **Go to your Resend Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks**
3. **Add a new webhook endpoint**:
   - **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/resend`
   - **Events**: Select `email.received`
   - **Secret**: Generate a secure secret (optional but recommended)

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Resend webhook secret (optional but recommended)
RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here

# Support team email
SUPPORT_TEAM_EMAIL=support@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. **Domain Configuration**

For incoming emails to work, you need to:

1. **Configure your domain** in Resend to receive emails
2. **Set up MX records** to point to Resend's servers
3. **Verify domain ownership** in Resend dashboard

## üìß **How It Works**
